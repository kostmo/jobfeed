This is not the first effort to solicit XML job feeds from companies.
Here's one site that I found in a Google search:

[http://www.inovahire.com/xml-job-feed InovaHire]

  * site is ad-sponsored.
  * lacks Google Maps integration
  * not as focused in scope (they also offer "live interview" services)
  * feeds share some similarities, but do not appear to facilitate fine-grained search based on individual skills.
