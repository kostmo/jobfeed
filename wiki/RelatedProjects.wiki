This is not the first effort to solicit XML job feeds from companies.
Here are just a couple I found in a Google search, along with some aspects to compare/contrast *jobfeed* with.

[http://www.simplyhired.com/a/add-jobs/feed#feed_spec SimplyHired]

  * lacks Google Maps integration
  * has way more jobs listed (as of now)
  * do not facilitate fine-grained search based on individual skills.

[http://www.inovahire.com/xml-job-feed InovaHire]

  * site is ad-sponsored.
  * lacks Google Maps integration
  * not as focused in scope (they also offer "live interview" services)
  * do not facilitate fine-grained search based on individual skills.
