#summary Why create this project?
#labels Featured

This project arose from a dissatisfaction with the status quo of technology job search sites. I wanted to be able to pick a location, quickly find jobs that matched my programming skills, and look up information about the employers.  Instead I found myself struggling with poorly designed user-interfaces and hampered by recruiting companies that obscure their clients' identity.

I have these objectives for the project:
  * fine-grained skill-based search
  * no hosting expenses
  * bypass recruiting middlemen
    * access employer organization identity transparently

The greatest challenge is that direct cooperation is required from employers in annotating their existing prose descriptions for searchability.  The advantages should be apparent to the hiring manager, however: it helps you find the right talent more quickly.  Hopefully it is recognized as a zero-risk, minimal-effort improvement upon the status quo.

== advantages ==

  * project is not profit-motivated
    * accomplished on no-cost infrastructure (until possibly a point in the distant future)
       * minimal storage and bandwidth used
         * prose job descriptions stored on original host, fetched client-side on demand
    * coded in a few days (cost of effort negligible)
  * free in every respect for job searchers and employers
  * need not replace existing systems; can merely augment them
