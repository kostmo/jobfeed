#summary Why create this project?
#labels Featured

This project arose from a dissatisfaction with the status quo of technology job search sites. I wanted to be able to pick a location, quickly find jobs that matched my programming skills, and look up information about the employers.  Instead I found myself struggling with poorly designed user-interfaces and hampered by recruiting companies that obscure their clients' identity.

I have these objectives for the project:
  * fine-grained skill-based
  * no hosting expenses
  * bypass recruiting middlemen
    * access employer organization identity transparently

The greatest challenge is that cooperation is required from employers' HR.  However, connecting with skill-matched employees it is to the employer's advantage, and hopefully they will recognize it as a low-risk improvement upon the status quo.

== advantages ==

  * project is not profit-motivated
    * accomplished on no-cost infrastructure (until possibly a point in the distant future)
       * minimal storage and bandwidth used
         * prose job descriptions stored on original host, fetched client-side on demand
    * coded in a few days (cost of effort negligible)
  * free in every respect for job searchers and employers
