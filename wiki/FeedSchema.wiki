#summary Description and justification of feed schema
#labels Featured

The [http://code.google.com/p/jobfeed/#example excerpt on the main page] gives an impression of what a feed should look like. Please examine a [http://code.google.com/p/jobfeed/source/browse/trunk/appengine/static/example_joblist.xml complete example].

Here is the [http://code.google.com/p/jobfeed/source/browse/trunk/appengine/static/jobfeed.xml official jobfeed schema] written in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELAX_NG RELAX NG]. You should [http://code.google.com/p/jobfeed/source/browse/trunk/appengine/scripts/validate.py validate] your own feed against this schema before [http://jobcrawlr.appspot.com/register submitting] it.

== job records ==
The following information should be associated with each job record:
  * location
    * Nominal location/address
    * geographic coordinates (Lat/Lon)
  * company name
  * position title
  * educational requirements
    * degree area/concentration
  * subject matter keywords
  * contract vs. permanent employment
  * required/preferred skills
  * expiration date

Since there may be many job openings at the same physical site, the XML schema allows one to specify the geographic coordinates just once for the site while being inherited by all the children.  Likewise for the company and/or department name.
