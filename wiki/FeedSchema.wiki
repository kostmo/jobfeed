#summary Description and justification of feed schema
#labels Featured

The [http://code.google.com/p/jobfeed/#example exerpt on the main page] gives a partial idea of the intended form of job feeds. Take a look at a [http://code.google.com/p/jobfeed/source/browse/trunk/appengine/static/example_joblist.xml complete example].

Here is the [http://code.google.com/p/jobfeed/source/browse/trunk/appengine/static/jobfeed.xml official jobfeed schema] written in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELAX_NG RELAX NG]. You should [http://code.google.com/p/jobfeed/source/browse/trunk/appengine/scripts/validate.py validate] your own feed against this schema before [http://jobcrawlr.appspot.com/register submitting] it.

== job records ==
Each job record should carry the following information:
  * location
    * Nominal location/address
    * geographic coordinates (Lat/Lon)
  * company name
  * position title
  * educational requirements
    * degree area/concentration
  * subject matter keywords
  * contract vs. permanent employment
  * required/preferred skills
    *  (e.g. - )
    * APIs/environments (e.g. - Google App Engine)
    * applications (e.g. )
    *  (e.g. )
  * expiration date

Since there may be many job openings at the same site, the XML schema allows one to specify the geographic coordinates just once for the site while being inherited by all the children.  Likewise for the company and/or department name.

Within the `<required>` or `<preferred>` tag the following are allowed:
|| *tag name* || *meaning* || *example value* ||
|| `<lang>` || programming language || Java ||
|| `<api>` || API/environment || Google App Engine ||
|| `<app>` || software application || AutoCAD ||
|| `<tools>` || other unclassified tool || multimeter ||
