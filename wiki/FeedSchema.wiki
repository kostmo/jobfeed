The [http://code.google.com/p/jobfeed/#example exerpt on the main page] gives a partial idea of the intended form of job feeds. Take a look at a [http://code.google.com/p/jobfeed/source/browse/trunk/appengine/static/example_joblist.xml complete example].

Here is the [http://code.google.com/p/jobfeed/source/browse/trunk/appengine/static/jobfeed.xml official jobfeed schema] written in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELAX_NG RELAX NG]. You should [http://code.google.com/p/jobfeed/source/browse/trunk/appengine/scripts/validate.py validate] your own feed against this schema before [http://jobcrawlr.appspot.com/register submitting] it.

== job records ==
Each job record should carry the following information:
  * location
    * Nominal location/address
    * geographic coordinate (Lat/Lon)
  * company name
  * position title
  * educational requirements
    * degree area/concentration
  * subject matter keywords
  * contract vs. permanent employment
  * required/preferred skills
    * programming languages (e.g. - Java)
    * APIs/environments (e.g. - Google App Engine)
    * other tools (e.g. multimeter)
  * expiration date

Since there may be many job openings at the same site, the XML schema allows one to specify the geographic coordinates just once for the site while being inherited by all the children.
