The [http://code.google.com/p/jobfeed/#example excerpt on the main page] gives an impression of what a feed should look like. Please examine a [http://code.google.com/p/jobfeed/source/browse/trunk/appengine/static/example_joblist.xml complete example].

Here is the [http://code.google.com/p/jobfeed/source/browse/trunk/appengine/static/jobfeed.xml official jobfeed schema] written in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELAX_NG RELAX NG]. You should [http://code.google.com/p/jobfeed/source/browse/trunk/appengine/scripts/validate.py validate] your own feed against this schema before [http://jobcrawlr.appspot.com/register submitting] it.

== job records ==
The following information should be associated with each job record:
  * location
    * Nominal location/address
    * geographic coordinates (Lat/Lon)
  * company name
  * position title
  * educational requirements
    * degree area/concentration
  * subject matter keywords
  * contract vs. permanent employment
  * required/preferred skills
  * expiration date

Since there may be many job openings at the same physical site, the XML schema allows one to specify the geographic coordinates just once for the site while being inherited by all the children.  Likewise for the company and/or department name.

Immediate children of the `<position>` element may be:
|| *tag name* || *meaning* || *example values* ||
|| `<title>` || title of the open position || Test Engineer ||
|| `<description>` || short prose description of the job || Applicant should be familiar with six-sigma and... Responsibilities include... ||
|| `<subject_matter>` || concise `<keyword>`s that describe the subject matter || `<keyword>biomedical</keyword><keyword>R&D</keyword>` ||
|| `<qualifications>` || `<education>`, `<preferred>`, and `<required>` || See below ||

Within the `<required>` or `<preferred>` tag the following are allowed:
|| *tag name* || *meaning* || *example values* ||
|| `<lang>` || programming language || Java, C++ ||
|| `<api>` || Library/API/environment || Google App Engine, OpenGL, Boost ||
|| `<app>` || software application || AutoCAD, git ||
|| `<equip>` || physical equipment or tool || multimeter, cash register ||
|| `<duty>` || process/task/duty/responsibility or other common activity || system administration, PCB layout ||
