    <h1>jobfeed - help</h1>
<p>Currently <tt>jobfeed</tt> is in the development/testing phase.  It is possible to <a href="/register">register</a> real feeds with the search engine, but there is also "simulated" data taken from randomly generated feeds. To search in this simulated data, check the box labeled "Search in sample jobs".</p>

<p>The simulated data has job listings for the top 20+ major US cities. Entering "Houston, TX", for instance, in the search box will show job openings near that area on the map. The map markers will likely overlap, but clicking on "List view Â»" will reveal all of them. By checking the box labeled "Filter by required experience", the results can be narrowed down by matching only jobs whos skill requirements overlap with those specified in the current "<a href="/profile">Search Profile</a>".</p>

<p>For convenience, multiple Search Profiles may be defined.  On the <a href="/">home screen</a>, when a profile is selected the skills chosen for that profile are displayed.</p>
